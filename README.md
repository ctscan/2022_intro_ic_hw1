#### Q2. Implement above function with Verilog

#### Q3. Design a logic in verilog which mimics a infinite width register. It takes input serially 1 bit at a time.  Output is asserted high when this register holds a value which is divisible by 5.  For example:

| Input | Sequence(bin) | Value(dec) | Output |
| ----- | ------------- | ---------- | ------ |
| 1     | 1             | 1          | 0      |
| 0     | 10            | 2          | 0      |
| 1     | 101           | 5          | 1      |
| 0     | 1010          | 10         | 1      |
| 1     | 10101         | 21         | 0      |

#### Q4. Please introduce yourself with name and place you live - and of course tell us your dream and how you either live it or are working towards living it!
A：名字陳維澤，居住在台中，我的夢想是做一個程式幫我維持生計，像是買股票賺錢之類的，讓我自由地想做甚麼都行。
